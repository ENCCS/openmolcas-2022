We are pleased to announce the **10th edition** of the OpenMolcas workshop,
bringing together the community of developers, users, and anyone else
interested in the project. This year the workshop is hosted by the Quantum
Chemistry Group at Uppsala University and we are very excited to announce that
we have partnered up with <a href="https://trex-coe.eu/" target="_blank">T-REX</a> and
<a href="https://enccs.se/" target="_blank">ENCSS</a>, which will help us with the organization, but most
importantly will contribute to the scientific part as well!

We invite everyone to join us here in sunny Uppsala, where the workshop will
take place, but we understand that in these uncertain times it might still be
difficult to travel. No worries, the workshop is offered in a hybrid format,
and anyone who registers is able to participate exclusively online.

As every year, this meeting is an opportunity for developers and users to
present their work and discuss about the future directions of the project.
Guest lecturers are invited as well, providing an external perspective and the
opportunity to create new collaborations.
