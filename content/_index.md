We are pleased to announce the **10th edition** of the OpenMolcas workshop,
bringing together the community of developers, users, and anyone else
interested in the project. This year the workshop is hosted by the Quantum
Chemistry Group at Uppsala University and we are very excited to announce that
we have partnered up with [T-REX](https://trex-coe.eu/) and
[ENCSS](https://enccs.se/), which will help us with the organization, but most
importantly will contribute to the scientific part as well!  

We invite everyone to join us here in sunny Uppsala, where the workshop
will take place, but we understand that in these uncertain times it might still
be difficult to travel. No worries, the workshop is offered in a hybrid format,
and anyone who registers is able to participate exclusively online.  

As every year, this meeting is an opportunity for developers and users to
present their work and discuss about the future directions of the project.
Guest lecturers are invited as well, providing an external perspective and the
opportunity to create new collaborations.

# How to reach Uppsala

Till och från flygplatsen kan du bekvämt åka vidare till Uppsala med både ULs
linje 801 från terminal 2-3, 4 och 5 och direkttåg med avgångar från SkyCity,
mellan terminal 4 och 5. Under dagtid går bussar och tåg två gånger i timmen.
Det är minst lika lätt att resa mellan Uppsala och Stockholm.

Om du vill resa med taxi så erbjuder de tre största taxibolagen i Uppsala bland
annat fasta priser för resor mellan Uppsala och Stockholm Arlanda Airport.

# Registration

Please mark if you are going to participate on-site or online via zoom, the
registration is in either case completely free of charge. In case of on-site
participation, please mark if you would like to join the gala dinner on
Thursday 9th June. The participants have to organize travel and accommodation
by themeselves.
